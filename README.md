# listApp_windows

I have dual-boot Windows 10 and Manjaro Linux which I frequently switch between. I use xpad on Linux and simple sticky notes on Windows because they both consume low memory and provide the basic function I need. I write small reminders and to-do list frequently and find that it would be useful if the apps were in sync and could share the same data. My goal for this project is to create an app for Windows and Linux which can replace what I already use but derive the notes simply from the same text file on a shared partition between the operating systems. This way when I take a note in Linux or Windows it will be there on the other operating system for if I switch over later.
